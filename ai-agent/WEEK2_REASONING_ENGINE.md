# Week 2: AI Cybersecurity Agent - Reasoning Engine 🧠

## Overview

Building the core reasoning capabilities for threat detection, pattern recognition, and security analysis.

## Architecture Components

### 🎯 **Threat Detection Agent**

Primary agent responsible for identifying security threats and anomalies.

### 🔍 **Pattern Analysis Engine**

Advanced pattern matching and behavioral analysis for threat classification.

### 🧮 **Risk Scoring System**

Quantitative risk assessment based on multiple threat indicators.

### 🔄 **Multi-Agent Coordination**

Orchestration between detection, analysis, and response agents.

## Implementation Plan

### Day 1-2: Core Agent Setup

- [x] Agent Framework installation
- [ ] Threat detection agent baseline
- [ ] GitHub Models integration (GPT-4.1)
- [ ] Basic threat classification

### Day 3-4: Pattern Recognition

- [ ] Security log analysis patterns
- [ ] Network traffic anomaly detection
- [ ] Behavioral baseline establishment
- [ ] IOC (Indicators of Compromise) matching

### Day 5-7: Advanced Reasoning

- [ ] Multi-vector threat correlation
- [ ] Risk scoring algorithms
- [ ] False positive reduction
- [ ] Automated threat prioritization

## Key Technologies

- **AI Model:** GPT-4.1 (reasoning) + Phi-4-Reasoning (specialized analysis)
- **Framework:** Microsoft Agent Framework (Python)
- **Data:** PostgreSQL + Redis for real-time processing
- **Communication:** Socket.IO for live updates

## Success Metrics

- **Detection Accuracy:** >95% threat identification
- **False Positive Rate:** <5%
- **Response Time:** <2 seconds for threat analysis
- **Pattern Recognition:** 100+ security patterns classified
