# Drill: Tabletop Exercise

## Objective

Describe the purpose of this drill: validate decision-making and communication flows without touching production systems.

## Scenario

Simulate a notification-channel outage where Resend and Twilio fail for 30 minutes during a high-traffic window.

## Steps

1. Preparation
   - Identify participants and observers
   - Prepare incident facts and simulated alerts
   - Create incident Slack channel: `#incident-tabletop-YYYY-MM-DD`
2. Execution
   - Walk through detection, assessment, containment, and communication
   - Role-play interactions with support and customers
   - Validate escalation chain and decision points
3. Recovery
   - Decide on remediation steps (rollbacks, failover)
   - Document decisions and temporary workarounds

## Outcomes

- Lessons learned
- Improvements required
- Action items assigned

## Post-Drill Notes

- Record time-to-decision metrics
- Save artifacts to `docs/drills/assessments/`
